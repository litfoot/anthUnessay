  <!-- Physical Adaptations Section -->
  <section class="content-section container">
    <h2 class="highlight">Physical Adaptations for Survival</h2>
    <p>
        Early humans had to face a myriad of different environments, from thick forests to freezing tundra, during their migration into Asia. Early humans slowly adapted physically over generations to this kind of condition.
        For example, in colder climates, the populations evolved to become more sturdy, with shorter limbs, in order to preserve body heat. These adaptations show the flexibility and continuity in the lives of early humans in different environmental settings.

  <!-- Tool Advancements Section -->
  <section class="content-section container">
    <h2 class="highlight">Advancements in Tool Technology</h2>
    <p>
        With early humans settling down into Asia, they were making and using more sophisticated tools, adapted to their respective environments. New materials for toolmaking were available in the region, such as bamboo and stone.
        This eventually led to the development of tools like bamboo spear tips, which were lightweight and successful for hunting through the forested areas. With time, humans in Asia developed various advanced stone tools, including microliths that were small but sharp, ideal for making efficient hunting tools.

  <!-- Cultural Adaptations Section -->
  <section class="content-section container">
    <h2 class="highlight">Cultural Adaptations and Social Structures</h2>
    <p>
        Besides physical and tool adaptations, early Asians developed specific cultural behaviors that may have helped them subsist in their new environments. For instance, temporary shelters were constructed, as well as animal skins, for warmth.
        Apart from this, social structures could have evolved through such activities as hunting of large animals, managing the available resources, and traversing hostile or unfamiliar terrains. This cooperation was seminal in allowing humans to survive and thrive across the vast Asian continent.
