    <h2 class="highlight">Why Did Early Humans Leave Africa?</h2>
    <p>
        Early humans are thought to have migrated out of Africa around 60,000-70,000 years ago in search of new resources, impelled by changing climatic conditions and other environmental imperatives.
        The changing climate in Africa generally caused the expansion of arid deserts, which may have made survival hard in certain regions, hence compelling our ancestors to explore beyond the continent.

    <h2 class="highlight">Key Fossil Discoveries</h2>
    <p>
      Our understanding of early humans is enriched by notable fossil finds. Here are a few key discoveries that shed light on our earliest ancestors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis)</strong>: Discovered in Ethiopia in 1974, Lucy dates back over 3 million years. She provides crucial insights into bipedalism and early hominid anatomy. Learn more about Lucy <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/australopithecus-afarensis-lucy-species.html" target="_blank" class="link-primary">here</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Homo erectus Fossils</strong>: Homo erectus, considered one of the first species to leave Africa, has been found in sites across Asia. Key fossils, like the Java Man in Indonesia, reveal adaptations that enabled long-distance migration. Explore the Homo erectus journey <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/Homo-erectus" target="_blank" class="link-primary">here</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Omo Kibish Fossils</strong>: Found in Ethiopia, these are some of the oldest known Homo sapiens fossils, dating back approximately 195,000 years, suggesting early populations thrived in East Africa.

  <!-- Early Migration Routes Section -->
  <section class="content-section container">
    <h2 class="highlight">Early Migration Routes</h2>
    <p>
        The early humans who migrated out of Africa probably followed coastal routes and the fertile river valleys, gradually reached the Middle East, and then eventually Asia.
        The studies undertaken show that, although some utilized the pathway through the Levant Corridor, others may have migrated south by coasts like the Arabian Peninsula.
